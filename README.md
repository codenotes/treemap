# treemap
Working with treemap code to extract the windows crap and get to the raw algo for use elsewhere. 

This is from 

https://www.viksoe.dk/code/index.htm

and it is a good rep. However, it is VERY old and the algo is very intertwined with Win32/ATL/WTL nightmares.  Am partsing it out bit by bit
by debugging and analysis.  IN the end, hope to have a good C++ TreeMap algo separate from all the entwinement.
